## Objectives

- **Understand MOSFET Fundamentals:** Learn the operation, characteristics, and parameters of MOSFETs, including I–V behavior, threshold voltage, and velocity saturation effects.  

- **Analyze CMOS Inverter Performance:** Study Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC) and transient response to understand switching behavior, gain, and propagation delays.  

- **Evaluate Noise Margins and Robustness:** Determine safe HIGH and LOW logic levels, compute noise margins, and assess the inverter’s resilience to voltage fluctuations and noise.  

- **Investigate Supply and Device Variations:** Examine the impact of V_DD changes and transistor sizing (W/L ratios) on VTC, switching threshold, noise margins, and timing, ensuring robust circuit operation across PVT corners.  

- **Develop Practical Design Insights:** Connect device-level behavior to circuit-level performance, enabling reliable, high-speed, and noise-tolerant digital design.
